Data Analysis of the 2024 April Pandabuy customers list leak
Work Still in Progress

# Goals
The general idea is to analyze demand in given regions of Poland and to map the data. Such information could be important for mapping the interest in fashion clothing. Later down the line, it should be used with other datasets â€“ say, pay inequalities in different regions, so some sociological information could be drawn. Project rather for fun, a combination of my passions for data science, sociology and streetwear. I still do believe that some actual useful data will be found in the process, which will be highlighted here as the work progresses.
